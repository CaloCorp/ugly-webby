# Ugly Webby

For our first CSS project, we aren't going to have the difficult job of having a vision in mind and trying to make it happen with CSS. In fact, we're going to be taking a reasonable-looking (if not beautiful) site and making it as unreasonable-looking as possible.

Fork this repo, then check out `style.css`. Play with the values, add new property-value combinations (maybe play with the `background-color` property?), add CSS rules for other selectors (`h3` for example doesn't have any rules for it yet!), and just generally mess stuff _up_.

Don't change the html _at all_, but `style.css` is your personal playground.

Or more like your tower of blocks to knock over. Your walls to crayon across.

We look forward to seeing what ugly phoenix rises from this repo's ashes. Good luck!


### Basic Setup

This is a `fork`-and-`clone` situation. Fork this repo on `github.com`, then clone down _your_ version (make sure your username is in the `url` you copy-paste into your terminal), and then you can proceed with the usual `add`, `commit`, and `push` routine. Ask a neighbor if you need help with _any_ of that!
